\noindent It was a long path to achieve finally this point in my life. And it was not an easy one. But no one said, that life is going to be easy.

\noindent I was about 12 years old, when I watched the sky the very first time with my a telescope, looking out for the most beautiful planet of our solar system. Being able to admire the ring structure of Saturn opened my eyes and my heart to explore the beauty of nature, the beauty of space. \\

\noindent While growing up, we try, driven by curiosity and fascination, to understand the world around us. We may seek answers to ``the big questions of life''. \\ 

{ \itshape
\noindent Where do we come from ? \\
Why did the universe come to existence ? \\
How old is the universe ? \\
Which mechanisms in nature guide the course of all events ? \\
What will happen in the future ? \\
Which role do I play in this unimaginable big universe ? \\
What is the purpose of my life ? \\
And, where do I want to go ? \\
}

\noindent Those are not easy questions. And that is why those questions are probably the oldest ones of humanity. \\
Throughout my ``journey of life'', I tried to find answers to those questions. Maybe, I could find some attempts to answer a few of those in this thesis. Maybe, I will never find an answer to some of these questions. \\

\noindent But at least, I found an answer, what the purpose of \textit{my} life is: to discover the beauty of nature. Going on with my journey, trying to find answers. And never giving up during this adventure - no matter, how hard and how frustrating life sometimes can be. No matter, how often I have fallen or I will fall down to the harsh ground of reality. Because it is my curiosity, my ambition and my passion that makes me standing up again to turn my eyes, my gaze into the sky. \\ 

\noindent That is the most important lesson I learned in the last years, studying physics. \\ 

\noindent The fact that I made it so far is not only through reading textbooks, doing my exercise sheets or preparing for exames. Because it is not only the effort I brought up. \\
I am where I am thanks to the effort of several people that came into my life. I am very glad that I had the luck to get to know these people. And therefore, this is the best occasion for me to thank them. \\

\noindent First of all, I want to thank my teachers, who not only taught me a lot, but also did their best to answer my difficult questions and quench my thirst for knowledge, which was probably not always easy and took a lot of patience, \\

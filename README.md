# Estimation of Cosmological Parameters in $`\Lambda`$CDM- and DGP-Model Using Supernovae Type Ia Data

## Abstract

In this thesis, we consider measurements of type Ia supernovae by the *Supernova Cosmology Project*, the dataset ["Union2.1"](https://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/), to obtain best-fit values to the free parameters of the $`\Lambda`$CDM-model, known as the "standard model of cosmology", and the DGP-model proposed by Gia Dvali, Gregory Gabadadze and Massimo Porrati.
While the $`\Lambda`$CDM-model describes the expansion of the universe by the existence of a cosmological constant $`\Lambda`$, the DGP-model introduces an additional spatial dimension to spacetime, in which gravity mimics the expansion of the universe by reaching the introduced crossover scale $`r_{\text{C}}`$.
After introducing theoretical backgrounds on how to relate physical quantities we observe like magnitude and redshift with the cosmological parameters that both cosmological models contain, we estimate best-fit values for the parameters $`\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\Omega_{\text{m},0}, \Omega_{\Lambda,0})`$ and $`\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\Omega_{\text{m},0}, \alpha)`$, where $`\alpha`$ is an interpolation parameter for which $`\alpha = 0`$ describes the $`\Lambda`$CDM-model and $`\alpha = 1`$ the DGP-model, by minimizing the $`\chi^2`$-distribution using the "Union2.1" SN Ia dataset.

In the case of estimating $`\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{best}} = (\Omega_{\text{m}, 0, \text{best}}, \Omega_{\Lambda, 0, \text{best}})`$, we obtain $`\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{best}} = (0.28, 0.72) \pm (0.07, 0.12)`$, which is consistent with the results provided by the *Supernova Cosmology Project* (see [Suzuki2012](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/746/1/85)).
In the case of estimating $`\boldsymbol{\theta}_{\text{best}} = (\Omega_{\text{m}, 0, \text{best}}, \alpha_{\text{best}})`$, we obtain $`(\Omega_{\text{m}, 0, \text{best}}, \alpha_{\text{best}}) = (0.28, -0.05)`$.

While an adequate estimation of $`\sigma`$-values for the individual parameters in the case of
$`\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\Omega_{\text{m},0}, \alpha)`$ is not possible by minimizing the $`\chi^2`$-distribution using the "Union2.1" dataset and we therefore cannot make any final judgement in favor of any model, our results are indicative towards the $`\Lambda`$CDM-model.
